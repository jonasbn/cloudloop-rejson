description: Combine RedisJSON and RediSearch to index and search JSON documents
---

In addition to storing JSON documents, you can also index them using the [RediSearch](/docs/stack/search) module. This enables full-text search capabilities and document retrieval based on their content.

To use these features, you must install two modules: RedisJSON and RediSearch. [Redis Stack](/docs/stack) automatically includes both modules.

See the [tutorial](/docs/stack/search/indexing_json) to learn how to use RediSearch with RedisJSON.
